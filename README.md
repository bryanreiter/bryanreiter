# Hello I'm Bryan!👋

# Who am I?
  I'm a 3rd year computer science major at Temple University. Currently, I am unsure of the exact path I want to go down, but I am exploring and learning something new     everyday. <br>
  
  I love to:
  * Play the drums 🥁
  * Play video games 🎮 
  * Explore the city 🌆
  * Make memories with friends, family, and colleagues

# What do I know and what do I want to learn
  Currently, my two strongest programming languages are 
  * C
  * Java
  
  but I am hoping to expand to include more in the future.
  Right now my focus outside of school is on web development. Although I have yet to take classes around the topic, I want to get ahead and check it out. It has always     been something that has interested me, and now is the best time to start learning it. <br>

  Currently, I am utilizing The Odin Project to jumpstart by web development journey. Right now I am learning:
  
  * HTML
  * CSS
  
  But I hope to pick up Javascript soon!
